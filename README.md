# Codebase RAG Accelerator Project

This project involves creating an AI expert over a codebase using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I've implemented the ability to chat with a codebase so I can understand how they work and what can be improved.

For Context, This is how the /ai-coding-agent-help command works on Slack: given your query, the most relevant code is retrieved from the codebase and used to generate a response using an LLM.

For this project, I learned how to embed the contents of a codebase, insert them into a vector database called Pinecone, and then get answers to your queries based on the contents of the codebase using LLMs.
